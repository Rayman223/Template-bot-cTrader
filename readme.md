## How to Customize

### 1. Add Your Indicators

In the `OnStart()` method, instantiate your indicators as needed.  
Example:
```csharp
protected override void OnStart()
{
    // Example: myIndicator = Indicators.MyCustomIndicator(...);
}
```

### 2. Define Entry/Exit Logic

Edit the `CheckIndicatorConditionsForTradeType` method to implement your strategy:
```csharp
private bool CheckIndicatorConditionsForTradeType(TradeType tradeType, double price, double pricePrev)
{
    // Example: return myIndicator.Result.Last(1) > myIndicator.Result.Last(2);
}
```

### 3. Adjust Risk and Money Management

Modify the parameters at the top of the file or via the cTrader UI to suit your risk profile.

---

## Example Parameter Block

```csharp
[Parameter("Min Lot", Group = "Money Management", DefaultValue = 1, MinValue = 0.01)]
public double MinLotSize { get; set; }

[Parameter("Risk Per Trade %", Group = "Money Management", DefaultValue = 1.8, MinValue = 0.1, MaxValue = 2)]
public double RiskPercent { get; set; }

[Parameter("Max open positions", Group = "SL/TP", DefaultValue = 4, MaxValue = 10, MinValue = 1, Step = 1)]
public int MaxOpenPosition { get; set; }
```

---

## Logging

All major actions and warnings are logged using the `Log` method.  
Duplicate messages are suppressed for clarity.  
Logs can be viewed in the cTrader Automate log output.

---

## Limitations & Notes

- The template does not include any trading strategy by default.  
  You must implement your own indicator logic in the provided methods.
- Some features (like closing before rollover) may not work as expected in backtesting mode due to platform limitations (still in dev).
- Always test your strategy on a demo account before running it live.
